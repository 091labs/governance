# AGM - General Operating Procedure #
## Rules ##

This  stuff is generally considered "common sense" but as we grow it's important to emphasize these rules by which we expect all members and visitors to the space to follow to make best use of our shared space.

### Availability ###

A copy of any rules of the Labs including:

* The Constitution
* The General Operating Procedure

... must be accessible in the Labs at all times for both visitors and members to read.

### Operating Guidelines ###

* Visitors should be at least 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to enter the space.
* No alterations to the architecture of the space can be made without both discussion and general approval on the mailing list by the members and * Buildings Officer, and also not before approval of the Landlord.
* Obey the "campsite rule": leave the space in a better condition than how you found it. 
* Return equipment to its proper location. Every tool has a home. Send them home. 
* Perform an inspection of the space before you leave:
* Soldering Irons, ovens, high energy devices switched off
* Major lights off
* Equipment put away
* Check the bins
* If it looks full, take it out and place a new bin bag in the can.
* Brooms and hoovers are provided for your convenience.
* Do not unplug or turn off any power strip unless it could pose a hazard to the space or its inhabitants (e.g. power to a soldering iron or power tool* ). 
* If you have not been trained to use a piece of equipment (whether you know how to use it or not (sure about this???)), don't use it. Ask the * Buildings Officer or Room Captain for help.
* Buildings Officer and Room Captains are able to approve a member's use of any equipment that has been set as general use by the owner.
* They must be also trained in the use of the machine in advance to do so.
* Clean up the shrapnel from your work; use the hoover or brush to clean up debris from grinding, sawing, drilling, cutting, etc.
* Use sense when doing so: don't damage the hoover.
* Using a tool inappropriately or for a purpose other than for its design or in an unsafe manner is prohibited without prior approval.
* Proper safety equipment must be used at all times when using power tools. Wear  goggles and a mask if you are generating dust. Get help if you want * to get on a ladder (don't use the ladder alone).
* Open food containers, empty drink cans, and cups need to be rinsed in the sink before throwing into the bin unless you are taking the bins out when * you leave.
* If consumables are running low, send a request for replacements by contacting the Buildings Officer.
* Blatant or repeated disregard for these guidelines are grounds for termination of membership.

### Guidelines ###

1. The goal will be to always move from conflict towards discussion and help to enable exchange of ideas. 
2. When a conflict arises, a committee member should volunteer to mediate an in-person discussion. 
3. A committee meeting may be called to address the conflict. 
4. Anyone can email committee@091labs.org or an individual committee member to ask for mediation of a conflict or discussion. 
5. Any committee member that receives a request to mediate a conflict or discussion or volunteers to be a mediator should inform the rest of the committee that a mediation will occur and the parties that are involved. 
6. Recommended the resource for active mediation: http://www.ohrd.wisc.edu/onlinetraining/resolution/index.asp

## Members ##

### New Members ###

* Specific pigeonhole will be provided in new space for members to put new forms in
* Membership forms will be processed at least fortnightly
* New members will be sent a welcome email when their form is processed
* They will, at minimum, be added to:
  * private mailing list
  * public mailing list
  * 091 Labs website as Contributor
  * Can view 091 Labs calendar

### Probationary Members ###

* Not automatically deemed full active members.
* Can apply to be considered for full membership by member vote/consensus after being a member for 60 days (two 'standard' months).
* Under special circumstances, probationary members can apply to the committee before the end of this period, but application is at the discretion of the committee. A member vote would still be required for approval.
Certain considerations include:
  * Counted as a past 'Member in Good Standing' of other trusted hackerspace(s)
  * Previously 'Member in Good Standing' of 091 Labs
On becoming a full active member:
  * Account on 091 Labs website is updated to 'Author'
  * Can add new items to event calendar

### Grace period for arrears ###

Once a member is two calendar months behind in membership dues: 

* They will receive an email from the Membership Secretary informing them that they are overdue and that their access token may be disabled at the discretion of the committee if unpaid dues are still not forthcoming.

Once a member is three months behind in membership dues:

* They are marked as 'Inactive'
* Their access token is disabled - that is, they will not be able to gain access with their "key".
* Not able to vote at meetings
* @091labs.com email address suspended after 6 months, deleted after one year
* Can only book rooms/events providing there is at least one 'Active' member also backing the event.

Payment of overdue fees will reverse all above penalties (except loss of data from e-mail account deletion). Alternatively, the person may (at the discretion of the membership) be permitted to restart payments from the present time, but are reverted to "Probationary" status.

Members are encouraged to inform membership@091labs.com if they are ending their membership or putting that membership on hiatus to prevent charging of dues in error.

If a member is under financial stress and contacts the Membership Secretary before the time period has past, an alternate payment method may be arranged.

## Groups ##

### Internal ###

Run by 091 Labs members on behalf of 091 Labs

Events run by this type of group are discounted or free for members

A charge or donation from non-members is encouraged but not obligatory

Proceeds from the event after expenses go to the Labs

### External ###

091 Labs members may be involved in some capacity in the external group but that has no consequence to any decision regarding the group.

If the group has a very regular event

The entity of the group pays a regular membership.

If the group has a once-off/irregular event

The group is charged a fee.

## Storage ##

* Each member is permitted a box of size 35L for storage along with additional space available for general use equipment or current projects.

* A member can rent further storage boxes of up to size 35L for additional monthly fee.

* The different storage areas must be clearly defined

## Equipment ##

### General Use ###

In the event of items being made available to 091 Labs by the members

Any public-use items that are not being used by Labs' members over a reasonable period of time should be questioned on the private mailing list as to whether storage should continue.

The owner(s) or user(s) of the items then have one week to respond to the question with either a clarification or an offer of a solution.

If no response is made by the membership, it will be assumed that the item in question can be removed from the Labs.

The owner of the equipment then has two weeks to remove the item after which it will be otherwise removed.

The Labs should receive no profits from the removal of the item.

It should be offered online as available and, if not claimed by anyone, otherwise dumped.

The items in question should be inquired about on the mailing list at least three times if no responses are received on the previous attempts.

### Donation ###

In the event of items being offered as donations to 091 Labs

The owner of the items should contact the members in advance with the offer of the item detailing what the item is.

## Health & Safety ##

Members can volunteer to become part of a Health and Safety team operating under the Buildings Officer

These members will be required to have training in H&S areas 

They will be able to flag issues to the membership as important or dangerous

## Junk ##

Junk should be clarified as different to waste/rubbish i.e. hackable but otherwise resigned to dumping

The back door area of the Labs will be used for junk

Junk will be divided into at least:

* Electronics
* Cardboard/Leather/Craftscraps
* Metal/Wood
* Plastics

Junk will be removed from the Labs weekly on Sunday night/Monday morning

Any member can take something from the junk area for their own use

It should never return to general use area

It should be:

* used for a project or
* added to that member's personal storage or 
* removed from the Labs

## Decision Making ##
### Consensus Process ###

* Time available for decision making.
  * Deadline = One week for non-urgent items
* All proposals shall be dealt with on a separate mailing list dedicated to decision making.
  * It is the choice of each member individually as to whether they wish to pay attention to this mailing list.

## Membership Fee ##

The membership fee is paid at a set rate on a monthly basis. It is a contribution to the continued operation of the Labs and not a guarantee of continued existence. Members are encouraged to help with obtaining secondary means of income for the Labs that fall within our Aims.

### Standard Rate ###

&euro;30 should be described as the standard rate

### Student/Starving Hacker Rate ###

&euro;20 as the rate for members who are unable to afford the standard rate

### Friend of the Labs ###

&euro;10 per month. Details of member type in member section.

### Bulk Membership Rate ###

If a member wishes to pay either a lump sum of either 6 or 12 months, they may do so and receive a 1 or 2 month discount respectively. The member should be made aware that this does not constitute a definite guarantee of the continued existence of 091 Labs up to the point that their lump sum may cover.

### Couple Rate ###

&euro;5 each of a discount off the rate of any individuals who are both members of the Labs and in a long-term relationship.

### Referral Credit ###

If a member of the Labs has prompted a non-member to join, due to interactions outside of the Labs. Then that new member gets a &euro;5 discount on their first month membership. The older member receives &euro;5 credit if the new member stays for more than two months. Referrals get dealt with once every two months.
