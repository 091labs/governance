## Running an Event ##

### Types ###

* Events are weird and great, and don't have a teacher.
* Classes generally involved a teacher and slides or a presentation.
* Workshops are usually 'work at your own pace' events, without a presentation, but with someone around who has *some* experience and can help people out when they are stuck.

### Setup ###
